# The Tic Tac Toe Game

The game takes place on a 4x4 board and involves two players, X and O. X 
starts and players take alternate turns. The object of the game is to 
place four of your pieces in a row, either vertically, horizontally, or 
diagonally. If this is achieved, the game ends in a win, otherwise the 
game ends in a draw once no more moves are possible.
